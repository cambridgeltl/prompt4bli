**Prompt4BLI** aims to address Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) / Word Translation with autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs). We for the first time demonstrate that prompting multilingual LLMs for BLI outperforms traditional BLI approaches which rely on calculating cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWEs). While we show that prompting off-the-shelf LLMs can already establish new state-of-the-art BLI performance on many BLI language pairs, the Prompt4BLI repo also provides code for BLI-oriented fine-tuning which can further improve the results.
