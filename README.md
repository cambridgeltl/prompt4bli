**Prompt4BLI** aims to address Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) / Word Translation with autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs). We for the first time demonstrate that prompting multilingual LLMs for BLI outperforms traditional BLI approaches which rely on calculating cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWEs).
